- Strategic evaluation (king safety, pawn structure)
- Move accuracy classification (excellent, good, inaccuracy, mistake, blunder)

## üß† How the Advanced Engine Works

### ELO-Based Move Selection
The bot uses sophisticated algorithms to simulate realistic play at different skill levels:

- **2200-2500 ELO**: 85% best moves, occasional strategic inaccuracies
- **1800-2200 ELO**: 70% best moves, more tactical oversights
- **1400-1800 ELO**: 55% best moves, positional mistakes
- **1000-1400 ELO**: 40% best moves, frequent tactical errors
- **800-1000 ELO**: 25% best moves, beginner-level mistakes

### Personality System
Configure bot behavior with personality traits:
- **Aggression**: Passive to highly aggressive play
- **Positional Play**: Tactical focus vs. positional understanding
- **Tactical Awareness**: Ability to spot tactical motifs
- **Endgame Skill**: Endgame technique level
- **Opening Knowledge**: Depth of opening preparation

### Multi-PV Analysis
- Analyzes multiple candidate moves simultaneously
- Provides move rankings with evaluations
- Shows principal variations for top moves
- Calculates move accuracy percentages

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Stockfish not found" error:**
- Ensure Stockfish is installed and accessible
- Check the `STOCKFISH_PATH` in `chess_engine.py`
- Try using the full path to the Stockfish executable
- Test Stockfish installation: `stockfish` in terminal/command prompt

**GUI not displaying properly:**
- Ensure PyQt5 is properly installed: `pip install --upgrade PyQt5`
- Check Python version compatibility (3.7+)
- Try running with `python -m PyQt5.QtWidgets` to test PyQt5

**Analysis running slowly:**
- Reduce analysis time in settings (default: 3 seconds)
- Lower engine hash size if memory is limited
- Reduce number of threads in engine settings

**Import errors:**
- Install all dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check Python path and virtual environment
- Ensure all project files are in the same directory

**Opening book not loading:**
- Check that book files are in the correct directory
- Ensure book files are valid polyglot format (.bin)
- Books are optional - the engine will work without them

### Performance Optimization

**For better performance:**
- Increase engine hash size (Settings tab)
- Use more CPU threads for analysis
- Close other resource-intensive applications
- Use SSD storage for faster file access

**For lower resource usage:**
- Decrease analysis time
- Reduce engine hash size
- Use fewer threads
- Disable auto-analysis features
